# Rope Physics Simulattion

This project demonstrates a few foundational mechanics for a Unity-based system, including:
- A custom rope physics system that simulates basic rope behavior and constraints.
- Simulates a dynamic rope using Verlet integration and constraint relaxation. Each rope particle is affected by physics, but the system could benefit from further tuning and optimizations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity (Unity **6000.0.32f1** built-in render pipeline is used for development).
3. Experiment with the rope physics behavior in the **RopePhysics.Rope** class. The `UpdatePhysics` function applies simulation updates to particles.

### Current Progress
This project is in an **early development phase**. The following features are functional:
1. Basic `Transform` movement with keyboard input.
2. Fully functional rope physics system with simple constraints and collision handling.

### Planned Improvements
- **3D Visualization**: Adding visual representations for the rope (line renderer, procedural mesh, etc.).
- **Physics Updates**: The current physics implementation for the rope works but needs refined constraints, collision handling, and stability improvements.
- **Cloth Simulation Mechanics**: Enhance the existing rope physics system to support cloth simulation mechanics. Add physics for two-dimensional surfaces (like flags, curtains, or clothing), with proper collision detection, wind response, and realistic cloth tearing behavior.
